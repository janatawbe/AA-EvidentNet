# Reproducibility

## Seeds

The default seed for any single run is:

```text
42
```

Official multi-seed robustness/statistics reporting uses exactly these five
seeds (see `configs/experiments.yaml: default_seeds` and
`src/utils/seeding.SUPPORTED_SEEDS`):

```text
42, 123, 456, 789, 2026
```

`src/utils/seeding.set_seed(seed)` seeds Python's `random`, NumPy, and
PyTorch (CPU and, if available, CUDA), and sets `PYTHONHASHSEED`.

## Deterministic behavior

`set_seed(seed, deterministic=True)` (the default) additionally:

- calls `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True, warn_only=True)`
- sets `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True` and
  `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False`
- sets `CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:4096:8` (required by cuBLAS for
  deterministic GEMM on CUDA)

`warn_only=True` is used deliberately: some ops (especially in future
interpolation/augmentation code) may not have deterministic CUDA kernels.
Rather than crash, we warn and proceed — but any such warning should be
investigated before trusting exact bit-for-bit reproducibility of a given
run.

## Reference environment

Verified in this project's development environment (2026-08-26):

- OS: Windows 11
- Python: 3.10.11
- torch: 2.10.0+**cpu** — no CUDA GPU was available in this environment
  (`torch.cuda.is_available()` returns `False`). If you run on a machine
  with an NVIDIA GPU, install a matching CUDA build of torch instead (see
  https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and expect some numerical
  differences vs. CPU-only runs.
- torchvision: 0.25.0+cpu, timm: 1.0.28 (added for Task 5 — model
  infrastructure). **Pinned deliberately**: an unpinned
  `pip install torchvision` resolves the latest torchvision (0.28.0 at
  time of writing), which in turn upgrades torch itself (observed: torch
  2.10.0 -> 2.13.0). To add torchvision without upgrading torch, always
  install both together with torch pinned:
  `pip install torch==2.10.0 torchvision==0.25.0` (0.25.0 is the
  torchvision release that pairs with torch 2.10.0).
- numpy 2.2.6, pandas 2.3.3, pillow 12.1.1, PyYAML 6.0.3,
  scikit-learn 1.7.2, pytest 9.1.1

Exact pins live in `requirements.txt` / `environment.yml`. Every run should
also capture live environment info via
`src/utils/env_info.collect_environment_info()`, since pinned files describe
intent, not necessarily what was actually installed at run time.

## Model reproducibility (Task 5)

- Baseline model architectures (`src/models/factory.py: create_model`) are
  entirely config-driven (`configs/models.yaml: baselines.*` — backbone
  name, `pretrained`, `num_classes`, `dropout`); no architecture constant
  is duplicated in source.
- `python run_pipeline.py model_check` (and the pytest suite) always use
  `pretrained=False` by default — fully offline, deterministic given a
  fixed torch/timm version, no network access or weight download
  required. `feature_dim` and parameter counts in
  `results/tables/model_parameters.csv` are read from the actually
  instantiated model, never hand-typed. The MaxViT variant
  (`maxvit_tiny_tf_224`, pretrained tag `.in1k`) was checked against the
  installed `timm==1.0.28` (`timm.list_models(..., pretrained=True)`)
  rather than assumed to exist.
- `--pretrained` on `model_check` additionally downloads real
  ImageNet-pretrained weights — this is the one place in this project
  that requires internet access, and it is never invoked by the default
  `pytest` suite or by `prepare_dataset`.
- No model has been trained yet, so weight-initialization and
  training-loop reproducibility are not yet applicable — only
  architecture instantiation and the forward-pass interface are verified
  at this stage.

## Configuration hashing

All hyperparameters live in `configs/*.yaml`, not hardcoded in source.
`src/utils/config.load_config` loads a YAML file; `hash_config` produces a
deterministic SHA-256 digest of its content (independent of key order).
Every experiment run should log its resolved config's hash so that any two
runs can be checked for having used identical settings.

## Dataset and manifest hashing

`src/utils/hashing.hash_file` computes a SHA-256 digest of a single file's
bytes; `hash_string` hashes an arbitrary string (used for
`build_split.compute_original_id`). `hash_manifest` combines a list of
`(relative_path, file_hash)` pairs (order-independent) into one digest
representing an entire dataset manifest.

`prepare_dataset` (`src/data/build_split.py`) produces exactly this
provenance for the original 70/20/10 split: `data/audit/{train,val,test}_manifest_hash.txt`
each hold the SHA-256 of their manifest file, and `data/audit/split_metadata.json`
records the seed, split ratios, `dataset_eligibility.csv`'s hash, the
config hash, git commit, full environment info, and per-manifest hashes
together — so any split can be traced back to the exact eligibility state,
config, and code commit that produced it. The same eligibility manifest +
config + seed always reproduces byte-identical `*_original.csv` files; a
different seed may produce a different (still valid, still leakage-free)
allocation.

The same `prepare_dataset` run then produces the balanced training set
(`src/data/generate_balanced_dataset.py`): `data/audit/train_balanced_manifest_hash.txt`
holds `train_balanced.csv`'s SHA-256, and `data/audit/balanced_dataset_metadata.json`
records the seed, target samples/class, `train_original.csv`'s hash, the
config hash (including a dedicated hash of just the augmentation
sub-config), git commit, and environment info. Every generated sample's ID
and its augmentation parameters are derived deterministically from
`(parent_original_id, canonical_class, augmentation_index, seed,
augmentation_config_hash)` — see `compute_generated_id` and `_sample_rng`
in `src/data/generate_balanced_dataset.py` — so generation is independent
of processing order and the same inputs always reproduce byte-identical
generated images and manifest. A different seed may produce different
(still valid) augmented images.

## Git provenance

`src/utils/git_info.get_git_commit()` and `get_git_status_summary()` report
the current commit SHA and whether the working tree is clean. These degrade
gracefully (returning `None` / `"not_a_git_repository"`) if run outside a
git repository. Every run record (see `EXPERIMENT_LOGGING.md`) should
include both, and a "dirty" tree should be flagged rather than hidden —
results from an uncommitted, modified codebase are not fully reproducible
until that code is committed.

## What is NOT yet guaranteed

- The original train/val/test split AND the balanced training set
  (`prepare_dataset`) are both reproducible and leakage-checked, but both
  are built on an eligibility state where 464 cross-class duplicate groups
  remain UNRESOLVED (see README.md) — both will change as those get
  human-reviewed, so treat them as provisional, not final.
- No model or training loop exists yet, so weight initialization and
  training dynamics reproducibility is not yet applicable.
- CPU-only determinism has been configured defensively but not empirically
  verified end-to-end, since there is no training loop yet to test it
  against.
